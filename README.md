Finding Neural tracks and locating puncta on it is a challenging tasks especially for images with low resulation and non-uniform low intensity distributions. The aims of this project were:
1. Finding neural tracks and visualization
2. Finding co-localized pucncta from red and green channel 
3. Detecting puncta located on neural tracks and measuring its area
4. finding dying cells

Tools and technique used:
1. Vaa3D to detect tracks
2. Connected components to detect puncta
3. visualization with python code
